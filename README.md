Code repository for manuscript "Rossby Wave Phase Speed Influences Heatwave Location through a Shift in Storm Track Position" submitted to Geophysical Research Letters by Wolfgang Wicker (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8951-2875) et al.

The Figures in the manuscript are complied from ERA5 reanalysis data that can be downloaded from the Copernicus Climate Data Store. The heatwave diagnosis requires global-mean monthly-mean near-surface temperature and daily-maximum near-surface temperature. These variables can be obtained from raw reanalysis data, for example, by using the Climate Data Operators (cdo).
